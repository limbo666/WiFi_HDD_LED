# WiFi_HDD_LED

A hardware LED indicator for your HDD/ SSD activity as seen on **Hackaday**:  https://hackaday.com/2019/02/26/blink-an-led-on-the-internet-of-things/

This **ESP8266** based circuit can be used to indicate the disk activity in a similar manner the physical LED on computer tower does. 

This project is combination of software and hardware. On the software side the open source **Activity Indicator**  https://sourceforge.net/projects/activityindicat/ should be used (available for Windows). For the hardware side (this project) a step by step guide is available on **Instructables** https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-HDD-LED/ .

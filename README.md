A hardware LED indicator for your HDD/ SSD activity as seen on **Hackaday**:  https://hackaday.com/2019/02/26/blink-an-led-on-the-internet-of-things/
This **ESP8266** based circuit can be used to indicate the disk activity in a similar manner the physical LED on computer tower does. 

This project is combination of software and hardware. On the software side the open source **Activity Indicator**: https://sourceforge.net/projects/activityindicat/ should be used The executable is available only for Windows OS. 


#### Step by Step Guide
For the hardware side (this project) a step by step guide is available on **Instructables** https://www.instructables.com/id/WiFi-HDD-LED/ .

#### Communication
The communication is based on UDP protocolover WiFi

#### Circuit
The circuit is quite simple.

All componets can be connected using the "deadbug" method.

Finally a box to hide all electronics should be used
